## 📝 Problem Statement

Finding suitable jobs and hiring qualified candidates is often a time-consuming and inefficient process. Job seekers struggle to access relevant opportunities and track applications, while employers face challenges in managing job postings and filtering candidates. Manual methods lead to delays, miscommunication, and lack of transparency.

**Solution:**  
This system provides a centralized digital platform where job seekers can apply for jobs and employers can post openings, review applicants, and manage the recruitment process seamlessly using Java and MySQL.

# 🎯 OOP Concepts Applied

**Encapsulation**  
All user details (JobSeeker, Employer, Admin) and job data are enclosed within dedicated classes.  
Internal data is hidden, exposing only necessary methods to interact with them.

**Abstraction**  
Abstract classes and interfaces define contracts for operations like job posting, job searching, and application submission.  
Users don’t need to know the underlying implementation details.

**Inheritance**  
Specialized classes like `JobSeeker`, `Employer`, and `Admin` extend a common `User` base class.  
Reduces redundancy and improves code reusability.

**Polymorphism**  
Methods such as `applyForJob()` or `postJob()` can behave differently depending on the object type.  
Supports both compile-time (method overloading) and run-time (method overriding) polymorphism.

**Modularity**  
The project is divided into modules:  
- **User Module** → Manages JobSeeker, Employer, and Admin profiles.  
- **Job Module** → Handles job postings and applications.  
- **Application Module** → Manages job applications and status tracking.  
- **Database Module** → Handles MySQL database operations via JDBC.  
- **UI Module (Optional)** → Handles JavaFX interactions.
